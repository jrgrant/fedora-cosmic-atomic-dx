# /diagnose \<scope\> [--out \<dir\>]

`/diagnose` is the human-facing surface for the `diagnostic-legibility`
agent. A human types `/diagnose <scope>`; the command dispatches the
agent in `mode: full` (the build → self-challenge → cross-check
pipeline), renders the returned `LegibilityModel` as a readable report,
and — after the human accepts — writes the report to disk.

The command chooses `mode: full` on the human's behalf: a human asking
to diagnose a scope wants the whole pipeline, not a partial pass. The
agent's `cross-check-only` mode is **not** exposed here; it remains a
bare-`Task`-tool affordance.

## Usage

```text
/diagnose <scope> [--out <dir>]
```

- `<scope>` — **required** positional. A directory path, a list of
  files, or a free-text description of the area to diagnose. Passed
  through to the agent verbatim.
- `--out <dir>` — **optional** directory override for where the report
  is written. The filename convention still applies beneath it.

There are no subcommands — `/diagnose` is a single verb (unlike
`/model-card create | seed`). A future re-render or comparison mode can
be added as a subcommand without breaking this signature.

## Flow

### 1. Parse args

1. **`<scope>`** — required positional. If absent, surface the usage
   error `/diagnose requires a <scope> argument` and abort: no agent
   dispatch, no file written.
2. **`--out <dir>`** — optional directory override.

### 2. Resolve scope

The command does **no** scope validation and **no** filesystem stat. It
forwards `<scope>` to the agent's `scope:` line verbatim. The agent
inspects the scope with `Glob`/`Grep`/`Read` and owns the three scope
forms and the empty-scope contract; an unresolvable scope is not a
command-level error (the agent emits the `(empty scope)` sentinel). The
scope contract lives in one place — the agent — so the command does not
duplicate it.

### 3. Resolve output path

Default output path:

```text
diagnostic-legibility/output/<scope-slug>-legibility-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
```

- **Directory** — default `diagnostic-legibility/output/`, overridden by
  `--out <dir>` (highest priority). Created with `mkdir -p` at write
  time (step 9), only on accept. A missing `--out` directory is not an
  error. The default directory is gitignored — reports are derived,
  regenerable artefacts, never committed source.
- **`<scope-slug>`** — a filesystem-safe slug from `<scope>`: lowercase,
  non-alphanumeric runs collapsed to single hyphens, leading/trailing
  hyphens trimmed (`./src/auth/` → `src-auth`). If the slug is empty
  after trimming, fall back to the literal `scope`.
- **`<YYYY-MM-DD>`** — the date the command resolved when substituting
  the `generated_at` placeholder (step 6). The command supplies the
  date; the agent never does. The report body's `generated_at` ISO 8601
  timestamp and the filename's `<YYYY-MM-DD>` derive from the same
  resolved instant.
- **Extension** — `.md`. The report is human-readable markdown; the raw
  YAML is **not** embedded.

### 4. Dispatch the agent in `mode: full`

Dispatch the `diagnostic-legibility` agent via the `Task` tool:

- `subagent_type`: `diagnostic-legibility`
- `description`: a short imperative, e.g. `"Diagnose ./src/auth/"`
- `prompt`: first line `mode: full`, second line `scope: <scope>`
  (passed through verbatim).

The agent returns **one of**:

- a markdown response containing a `LegibilityModel` YAML block, or
- a single structured refusal line `diagnostic-legibility refusal:
  <reason>.` with **no** YAML block.

### 5. Handle a refusal

If the response contains a line matching `diagnostic-legibility
refusal:`:

1. Surface the refusal line **verbatim** to the conversation.
2. **Abort** — render nothing, write nothing, perform no `mkdir`.

**Fail safe.** A refusal line present at all routes here and aborts —
**even if a YAML block also appears** in the response. The agent
contract forbids that composite (a refusal line is the entire
response), so this only ever fires on genuinely malformed agent output,
where refusing to render is the safe choice. Do not fall through to the
render path on a refusal line just because a stray YAML block is also
present.

(In `mode: full` the agent's documented precondition violations are not
reachable through `/diagnose`, since the command always sends a valid
`mode: full` prompt with no supplied payload. The refusal path is
retained as a defensive contract so the command degrades safely rather
than writing a malformed report.)

### 6. Render the report

Parse the `LegibilityModel` YAML and substitute the `<DISPATCHER: ...>`
placeholders before rendering, so the report body carries concrete
`generated_at` and `generated_by` values. Render per the report
structure below.

### 7. Validation checkpoint

Before the confirm-before-write gate, read the rendered report back and
check its structure (per CLAUDE.md "Output Validation Checkpoints"). The
checkpoint's scope is deliberately **narrow** — it verifies only what it
can genuinely check against the parsed agent YAML, and is **not** an
independent oracle for renderer correctness. The genuine last line of
defence is the human accept gate (step 8), not this checkpoint. Checks:

1. **Header present and complete** — the `# Diagnostic Legibility report
   —` title and all six metadata rows.
2. **No unsubstituted placeholders** — the report contains no literal
   `<DISPATCHER:` substring. This is the load-bearing check: a report
   that leaks `<DISPATCHER: ...>` to a human has failed the surfacing
   contract.
3. **Cross-check summary present** — the `## Cross-check summary`
   section exists, states one of `completed | skipped_asymmetric |
   not_run`, and reports both A→D and D→A counts, each consistent with
   the parsed YAML under the elements-revised definition.
4. **Both collections rendered** — every `architectural[]` and
   `domain[]` element from the YAML appears (matched by `name`); counts
   match.
5. **Q/CC ordering present** — for every element, `CC<N>` entries render
   after `Q<N>` entries.
6. **Counts consistent** — header counts match the rendered blocks and
   the parsed YAML.

Deviations are fixed in place; the agent is **not** re-dispatched. If
the YAML cannot be parsed at all (malformed, not a refusal), surface the
parse failure and abort without writing a partial report.

### 8. Print the summary and confirm before write

Before any file is written:

1. Print the conversation summary (below), naming the **resolved**
   target path, the per-collection element counts, the
   `cross_check_status`, and the A→D / D→A correction counts.
2. **Flag an overwrite.** If a file already exists at the resolved path,
   state explicitly that writing will **overwrite** it (named path
   shown), so a slug-collision or same-day re-run cannot silently
   destroy an earlier report.
3. **Prompt the human to accept or abort.** The report is a
   human-facing artefact; the human sees the rendered result and
   disposes of it before it lands on disk. This accept/abort step — not
   the validation checkpoint — is the last line of defence before write.

On **abort**: write nothing, perform no `mkdir`, exit. On **accept**:
proceed to step 9.

### 9. Write the file (on accept only)

1. `mkdir -p` the resolved output directory.
2. Write the rendered report to the resolved path, and confirm the
   written path.

This runs only after the human accepts at step 8 — a real pre-write
disposition (agent-emit + dispatcher-persist + human-disposes), not a
post-hoc read of an already-written file.

## Report structure

### Header

```markdown
# Diagnostic Legibility report — <scope>

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scope | <scope> |
| Generated at | <resolved ISO 8601 timestamp> |
| Generated by | diagnostic-legibility / <resolved model identifier> |
| Cross-check status | <completed | skipped_asymmetric | not_run> |
| Architectural elements | <N> |
| Domain elements | <M> |
```

### Cross-check summary

A `## Cross-check summary` section immediately after the header:

- A one-line statement of `cross_check_status` in human terms:
  - `completed` → "Cross-check ran on both collections."
  - `skipped_asymmetric`, **and the populated collection has real
    elements** → "Cross-check was skipped: only one collection was
    populated."
  - `skipped_asymmetric`, **and the only element present is the `(empty
    scope)` sentinel** → "Scope yielded no elements; cross-check did not
    run." Branch the gloss on the sentinel: the agent emits the same
    wrapper value (`skipped_asymmetric`) for a genuinely empty scope as
    for a true one-sided scope, so the command distinguishes the two for
    the human. Do **not** tell a human "one collection was populated"
    when the scope yielded nothing.
  - `not_run` → "Cross-check did not run." **Note:** `not_run` is **not
    produced by `/diagnose`** — a `/diagnose` run always dispatches
    `mode: full` against a freshly-emitted model, which always carries
    the field. This gloss exists for forward-compatibility when
    rendering an externally-supplied or v0.3.0-era model where the field
    is absent.
- **Correction counts by direction.** A direction's count is the
  **number of elements in that collection carrying at least one `CC<N>`
  entry** ("elements revised") — *not* the raw number of `CC<N>`
  entries. An element that fired two cross-check questions counts once.
  - **A→D corrections** — architectural elements carrying ≥1 `CC<N>`
    entry.
  - **D→A corrections** — domain elements carrying ≥1 `CC<N>` entry.
  - The CC-applied sentinel (`Cross-check applied; no questions surfaced
    changes`) is not a `CC<N>` entry and does not make an element count
    as revised.
  - **This is a lower bound on elements touched.** The count captures
    elements revised *as the subject* of a cross-check (the `CC<N>`
    entry lives on the subject only, per the agent's subject-only audit
    trail). A sibling element revised as a *side effect* — named in a
    subject's `CC<N>` prose but carrying no `CC<N>` entry of its own — is
    a genuine correction that is **not** counted. Read the figure as
    "elements revised as cross-check subjects", not "every element the
    cross-check touched".

```markdown
## Cross-check summary

Cross-check ran on both collections.

- A→D corrections (architectural elements revised by the domain frame): <count>
- D→A corrections (domain elements revised by the architectural frame): <count>
```

### Side-by-side summary table and stacked model bodies

The geometry is **pinned**:

1. **A compact two-column cross-check summary table** near the top — the
   genuine at-a-glance **side-by-side**. One column per collection
   (Architectural | Domain), summarising each side's element count and
   elements revised by cross-check. This table is the only part of the
   report the word "side-by-side" refers to.

   ```markdown
   | | Architectural | Domain |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Elements | <N> | <M> |
   | Elements revised (cross-check) | <A→D count> (A→D) | <D→A count> (D→A) |
   ```

   The per-cell `(A→D)` / `(D→A)` labels bind each count to its
   definition above: the **Architectural** column's revised cell is the
   A→D count (architectural elements carrying ≥1 `CC<N>` entry), the
   **Domain** column's is the D→A count. The label prevents transposing
   the two counts when copying this table template.

2. **The model bodies as two stacked subsections** under a `## Models`
   section: `### Architectural model` first, then `### Domain model`.
   The bodies are stacked, not side-by-side — wide free-text element
   blocks render poorly in a two-column table.

Each element renders as a sub-block:

- `### <name>` heading
- `confidence: <low | medium | high>`
- the `description` (multi-paragraph preserved)
- `evidence` — a bullet list of `path` (and `excerpt` when present)
- **`challenge_notes` grouped by prefix**, self-challenge first then
  cross-check:
  - a **Self-challenge** group — the `Q<N>` entries (and the `Challenge
    applied; no questions surfaced changes` sentinel when present)
  - a **Cross-check** group — the `CC<N>` entries (and the `Cross-check
    applied; no questions surfaced changes` sentinel when present)
  - empty `challenge_notes[]` renders as `_(challenge not run)_` so the
    human can distinguish "ran cleanly" from "never ran".

The raw `LegibilityModel` YAML is **not** embedded in the report.

### Conversation summary
